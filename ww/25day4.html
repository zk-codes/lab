                <p>I've never thought much about curating one's existence...until I discovered the internet.</p>
                <p>My entire childhood, the external world did the filtering for me: the school and public library, my parents and grandparents, and friends.</p>
                <p>While I reveled in the glorious overwhelm at first (and still do, often) the longer I live, the more I envy the baleen whale. It can sit with its mouth open, trawling through the open sea with all its overwhelming offerings, yet it only consumes the things it wishes to.</p>
                <p>But I? If I don't discern, I drown.</p>
                <p>I've tried everything under this earth, which has helped some. An RSS reader, bookmarks, Obsidian clippings, 'to read' lists, and an extensive blocklist of sites I don't wish to visit.</p>
                <p>And yet. I misplace things. Swear I'll return to them but never will. Lose track of time yet not remember what I spent it on. Try some organizaing that falls apart when I lose enthusiasm.</p>
                <p>What else is there left to try? Tell me, oh wise whale: how do I filter feed?</p>
